## Project Overview  
The Legal Chatbot Project applies natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to simplify access to legal information. It processes user queries, interprets intent, and provides relevant answers based on a curated knowledge base. By using preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, and vectorization, combined with classification models, the chatbot translates complex legal terms into more understandable language.  

This project is intended as an educational and informational tool. It does not replace professional legal advice but instead provides users with a quick reference point for topics such as contracts, rights, and general legal concepts.
